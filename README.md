  Uses the **Perplexity API (LLM)** to analyze AMU data, detect improper drug usage, and recommend corrective actions.

- 🎙️ **Voice-Based Data Entry:**  
  Accepts **natural-language voice input** and converts it into structured JSON records using LLM processing.

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards:**  
  Visualize feed, yield, and AMU data through dynamic, responsive charts and analytics.

- ⚙️ **Comprehensive Record Management:**  
  Add and manage animals, health reports, feed, yield, and AMU entries with ease.

- 🔒 **Secure Backend & API Design:**  
  Built with **Django REST Framework**, ensuring robust authentication, data persistence, and modular API endpoints.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

**FarmSense** follows a modular architecture:

- **Frontend** communicates with **Django REST API** via secured endpoints.
- **Voice Transcription Module** captures audio input, transcribes it, and sends it to the **Perplexity LLM**.
- **AI Engine** returns structured JSON, which the backend saves into the database.
- **Insights Engine** generates visual and textual analytics (charts + AI insights).
